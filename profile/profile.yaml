# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: My name is Francois Lippe and I am a Bishop's University graduate in Computer Science. I am currently employed as a Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting Group, where I have been able to learn new and trending technologies and methodologies. My last job was with Bombardier (BRP) as a web integrator where I was tasked with integrating web pages with the application AEM.
  Before that, I was a service desk technician for CGI. Because I have always been surrounded by various technologies, I have always been curious about their inner workings. At a young age, I would spend some of my time learning how to make games using an editor on one of my games. Growing up I decided to direct this passion into a career.

    description:  The project is meant to monitor each node of the server by recording their hardware specifications as well as their resource usage (e.g. CPU/Memory) in real-time. The collected data is then stored in an RDBMS database. This database is meant to be used by the LCA team (Jarvis Cluster Administration) to generate reports for future resource planning purposes (e.g. add/remove servers).
