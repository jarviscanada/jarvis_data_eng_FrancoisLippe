summary: My name is Francois Lippe and I am a Bishop's University graduate in Computer Science. My last job was with Bombardier (BRP) as a web integrator. I was tasked with integrating web pages as per the template with the application AEM.
  Before that, I was a service desk technician for CGI. During this time, I did basic troubleshooting for our clients. Since a very young age, I have always been curious about how technology works. I used to program my consoles so that I could directly download games onto them. I also created custom games in warcraft 3 using their editor.

    description:  The project is meant to monitor each node of the server by recording their hardware specifications as well as their resource usage (e.g. CPU/Memory) in real-time. The collected data is then stored in an RDBMS database. This database is meant to be used by the LCA team (Jarvis Cluster Administration) to generate reports for future resource planning purposes (e.g. add/remove servers).
