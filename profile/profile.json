  "summary": "My name is Francois Lippe and I am a Bishop's University graduate in Computer Science. I am currently employed as a Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting Group, where I have been able to learn new and trending technologies and methodologies. My last job was with Bombardier (BRP) as a web integrator where I was tasked with integrating web pages with the application AEM. Before that, I was a service desk technician for CGI. Because I have always been surrounded by various technologies, I have always been curious about their inner workings. At a young age, I would spend some of my time learning how to make games using an editor on one of my games. Growing up I decided to direct this passion into a career."
