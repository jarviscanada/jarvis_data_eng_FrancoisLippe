  "summary": "My name is Francois Lippe and I am a Bishop's University graduate in Computer Science. My last job was with Bombardier (BRP) as a web integrator. I was tasked with integrating web pages as per the template with the application AEM. Before that, I was a service desk technician for CGI. During this time, I did basic troubleshooting for our clients. Since a very young age, I have always been curious about how technology works. I used to program my consoles so that I could directly download games onto them. I also created custom games in warcraft 3 using their editor."
